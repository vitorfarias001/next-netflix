| `dev`           | Starts a development instance of the app |

### Warning

If you are having problems with "Favorite"  functionality throwing "Not Signed In" error, It is because you have a newer version of Next & NextAuth, a small modification is needed (you can find it in the github repostory). Here are the steps:

1. Your [...nextauth].ts file should export authOptions separately
2. Your serverAuth.ts file should use getServerSession(req, res, authOptions) instead of getSession({req})
3. Modify serverAuth(req) to serverAuth(req, res) everytwhere in your code.
4. Logout, shutdown the app, login again, everything should work ‚ù§
